### Want to lead a trip?
#### What is a trip?
It can be as simple as doing yoga by Scripps or as big as a multi-day trip to the Sierras.
If you want to share your enjoyment of the outdoors with others, you should consider leading a trip!
#### What does it mean to lead a trip?
It's a willingness to show others the ropes and giving them a chance to enjoy the excursion you have.
It's also about knowing how to do the excursion safely.
#### How do I lead a trip
Send an email to [toc@ucsd.edu](mailto:toc@ucsd.edu) with some information about your trip and how others can join in:
* Do you need someone with a car? Do you already have the transportation lined up?
* How many spots do you have?
* Where/when will it start & end?
* What gear do folks need?
* How can TOCers interested in the trip get in touch with you?
